# Eventually Consistent Partying

being my submission for [SIGBOVIK 2019](http://www.sigbovik.org/2019/).

It brings eventual consistency to partying, and finally gives us a way to reason
about how buzzed we all need to get to have a good time. You can read [the
PDF](/eventually_consistent_partying.pdf) tonight.

Have fun!
